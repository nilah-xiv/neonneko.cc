## ✨ What Is Neon Neko?

**Neon Neko** is more than a venue — it’s a *vibe.*  
A retro-futuristic, cyber-dreamy space inspired by Tokyo arcades, soft synths, neon signs, and the magic of Eorzean nightlife.

We host:
- 💃 Themed RP events & live music
- 🎰 Gambler-friendly mini-games
- 🍹 Custom-designed drinks & dishes
- 🌈 Fully staffed, lore-friendly atmosphere
- 📸 Venue photo ops & staff interactions
